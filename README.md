Useful notes:
(1)   Point totals   for each question are given in brackets.    The actual exam   may   have   more   or
fewer   points.    Use   the   point   totals   for   the   questions   to   help   you   allocate   your   time   effectively.
(2)   The actual midterm may have multiple choice questions, definition questions or a   combination of these types   of   questions.
(3)   The actual midterm will have one or more short answer questions.    Make sure to show   your   work and explain   your steps   for   full credit.
(4)   The actual midterm will be shorter.   I   made the sample midterm longer to give   you more examples of the types of questions   which might appear   on   the   exam.
Question   1   [18 points]
Circle the correct answer to each multiple choice   question.
a)    The   population   variance   of   the   random   variable      X   equals:
A)      
B)       for   a   continuous   random   variable
C)      
D)      
b)    If   β1    denotes   the   OLS   estimator   of   the   slope   coefficient,   E(β1)   is:
A)    A random variable
B)    An estimate
C)    An estimator
D)   None   of   the   above
c)    The least squares estimator of   the slope   coefficient   in   the   linear regression model   with   one   regressor is the:
A)    sample   covariance   of   X   and   Y   divided   by   the   sample   variance   of   Y
B)    sample   variance   of   X   divided   by   the   sample   covariance   of   X   and   Y
C)    sample   covariance   of   X   and   Y   divided   by   the   sample   variance   of   X
D)   population   covariance   of   X   and   Y   divided   by   the   population   variance   of   Y
Question 2   [12 points]
a)    Define what it means for an estimator to be unbiased.
b)    Define the least squares estimator of   the slope   coefficient   in the   linear regression model   (with   one regressor) in terms of   sample variances and sample covariances.
Question 3   [30 points]
You are interested in the causal effect of   attending   the midterm   review   session   on   a   student’s   midterm exam score. The following table shows the potential   exam   scores,   actual   exam   score, and whether the student attended the review for 5   students. yi denotes the   actual   exam   score   for   person   i, Di    is an indicator for whether person   i   attended the review session,   and the potential   outcome notation is   the same as used   in   class.

Di11001a)   What is the causal effect of   attending the review   session on   Torben’s   exam   score?
b)    Define the average effect of   treatment on the treated   (ATT).
c)   What is the   ATT for this population of   students?
d)    Suppose you only have access to the variables   yi      and Di .    What   is the mean   difference   in   exam scores between those who attended the review session and those who   did not?
e)    Decompose the difference in part d into the true causal   effect of   attending   the   review   session   for the treated group and the selection bias.    Write out the   decomposition   as   a   formula before plugging in any numbers for   full   credit.
Question 4   [30 points]
Adult males are taller, on average, than adult females.      You   suggest   to   your   little   sister that   she   collect data on height and gender of   children in the   6th   grade   in her   school   district   (which has   hundreds of   6th graders) as part of   her science project.      She collects   a   simple random   sample with   the   help   of   district. The   accompanying   table   shows   her   findings.

a)    Suppose you want to test whether 6th    grade boys and girls in the   school   district   are the   same   height.    Write down the null and alternative hypotheses.
b)    Calculate the difference in mean heights and the standard   error of   this   difference.
c)    Calculate the appropriate t-statistic for the test you wrote down in part   (a).      Do   you   reject   the   null hypothesis at the   1% significance level?
d)    What is the asymptotic distribution of   yb?    Be specific;   don’t   just   state the   distribution’s name.
e)    What result or theorem are you appealing to for your answer   in   part   (d)?
Question 5   [20 points]
The   sample   covariance   between   the   random   variables   X   and   Y   is:
   
Prove that this is identical to the following alternative specification:

Question 6   [30 points]You download a dataset of 1,744 individuals from   the   Current   Population   Survey,   which   you   are told is a simple random sample of   the entire U.S. population.      You   are   interested   in   the relationship between weekly earnings and age.    OLS regression yields the following result:
yi      =   239.   16   +   5.20xi
R2      =   0.05, RMSE   =   287.21
where   yi      is   predicted   weekly   earnings   in   dollars   and   xi      is   age   in   years.
a)    Interpret the estimated intercept.    Does a literal   interpretation make   sense here?
b)    Interpret   the   regression   R2   .
c)    How much weekly earnings would the regression model predict a 32 year old woman   would   earn?
